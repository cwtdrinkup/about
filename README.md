## History

Back in March of 2012, [Chris Ridenour](https://twitter.com/cridenour) and [Chris Moore](https://twitter.com/cdmwebs) had a quick [Twitter exchange](https://twitter.com/cdmwebs/status/185829571394932736) about bringing the local Python, Ruby and JavaScript user groups together. We're all fans of tech and keeping it in a few small silos felt strange. I'm interested in what the Python group is up to, too. We didn't want the formal user group structure, so we decided to start the [Cincinnati Web/Tech Drinkup](https://www.meetup.com/cwtdrinkup/). Turns out, people liked the idea.
